Simple Java class to simplify getting an embedded Elasticsearch node running in tests.

# License

See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

The license is the [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), a.k.a. the expat license. The rationale for choosing this license is that I want to maximize your freedom to do whatever you want with the code while limiting my liability for the damage this code could potentially do in your hands. I do appreciate attribution but not enough to require it in the license (beyond the obligatory copyright notice).
